## Challenge and Approach

Our submission is for Challenge #5: Encourage users to select options that relieve pressure on the overall transportation.
We aim to help new residents of Seattle find the right neighborhood with an experience that encourages informed transit choices.

Our approach for satisfying this challenge was to:

- Interviewed various residents about the challenges and priorities they identified when selecting housing
- Looked deeply at available datasets to discover ways to guide citizens relocating to the Seattle area toward better informed decisions
- Considered off-the-shelf API solutions to meet time constraints
- Discussed various design directions with mentors to distill down the decision tree for a natural user experience
- Focused and interated on intuitive, clean design to avoid information overload
